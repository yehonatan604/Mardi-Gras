                    Mississippi River in what is now
                    lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                    celebrated it as part of an
                    observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans
                    is unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                    cross-dressing).
                    An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and
                    wearing of masks in the
                    streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                    whenever such
                    restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                    In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised
                    money to fund an
                    official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                    Miscellaneous Pieces
                    describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.


                    The Carnival at New Orleans, 1885
                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                    frolic, and comic
                    masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
                    boys, women and
                    girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                    grotesque, quizzical,
                    diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and
                    birds, beasts and birds
                    with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats
                    from the moon;
                    mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons,
                    carts, coaches, cars,
                    &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                    fiddling, fifeing, and
                    all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

                    In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society
                    to observe Mardi Gras
                    with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
                    According to one
                    historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always
                    considered a French
                    festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday
                    had passed from
                    French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans
                    and its Creoles. To a
                    certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting
                    of how their business
                    prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                    Carnival passed from
                    Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth
                    century. The spectacle of
                    Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the
                    ballrooms and on the
                    streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                    American.

                    In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[5] War, economic, political, and
                    weather conditions
                    sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil
                    War, World War I and
                    World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

                    The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope
                    Co.[6][7] The rumored but
                    long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including
                    one transporting a
                    live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                    significant" by the
                    National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.</p>
