                    New
                    Orleans.
                    Celebrations are
                    concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the start
                    of lent in
                    the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
                    many days
                    have
                    several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                    Mardi
                    Gras season. In
                    the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                    parades and
                    balls (some
                    of them masquerade balls).

                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade
                    schedule and route
                    each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                    Knights
                    of Momus and
                    the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                    events
                    (often featuring
                    celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social
                    Aid &
                    Pleasure Club—a
                    predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
                    most
                    common throws are
                    strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                    toys.
                    Major krewes
                    follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate in
                    the Uptown and
                    Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side
                    of the
                    French
                    Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
                    downtown in the
                    Faubourg
                    Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                    concludes
                    with the
                    "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
